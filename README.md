# Stochastic Optimization:-
## 1).Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing originates from the analogy between the physical annealing process and the problem of finding minimal argument for discrete minimization problems. The physical annealing process is known in condensed matter physics as a thermal process for obtaining low energy states of a solid in a heat bath. In optimization Simulated Algorithm (SA) contains a probabilistic mechanism to escape a global minimum.

## 2).Random Search
Random search (RS) is a family of numerical optimization methods that do not require the gradient of the problem to be optimized, and RS can hence be used on functions that are not continuous or differentiable. Such optimization methods are also known as direct-search, derivative-free, or black-box methods.

## 3)Evolutionary Algorithms (EA):-
-Genetic Algorithms (GA),
-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
-Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),
-Artificial Bee Colony (ABC),
-Grenade Explosion Method (GEM),
-Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA),
-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
-Differential Evolution (DE),
