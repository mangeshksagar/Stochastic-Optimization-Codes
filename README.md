# Stochastic Optimization:-
## 1).Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing originates from the analogy between the physical annealing process and the problem of finding minimal argument for discrete minimization problems. The physical annealing process is known in condensed matter physics as a thermal process for obtaining low energy states of a solid in a heat bath. In optimization Simulated Algorithm (SA) contains a probabilistic mechanism to escape a global minimum.
